## How to read barcode from URL for barcode reader API in PowerShell and PDF.co Web API

### Learn how to read barcode from URL to have barcode reader API in PowerShell

We’ve created and updating regularly our sample code library so you may quickly learn barcode reader API and the step-by-step process in PowerShell. Barcode reader API in PowerShell can be implemented with PDF.co Web API. PDF.co Web API is the Web API with a set of tools for documents manipulation, data conversion, data extraction, splitting and merging of documents. Includes image recognition, built-in OCR, barcode generation and barcode decoders to decode bar codes from scans, pictures and pdf.

You will save a lot of time on writing and testing code as you may just take the code below and use it in your application. Open your PowerShell project and simply copy & paste the code and then run your app! Further enhancement of the code will make it more vigorous.

Our website provides free trial version of PDF.co Web API that includes source code samples to help with your PowerShell project.
